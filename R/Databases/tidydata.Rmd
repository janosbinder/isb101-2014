## Learning objectives
 * Good and data structures -- building your own data frames
 * Reproducible data using RMarkdown
 * Access to databases using R



## Cost of Genome

## Bigdata

## Real data management

## How bad is Excel
All your analysis will be required to be made available eventually

Examples where things went bad

 * Reinhart-Rogoff “Growth in a time of debt”
 * Potti et al., “Genomic signatures to guide the use of chemotherapeutics”
 * CLCN2 variants in IGE

Excel manipulations are inherently non-tractable 




## Reproducibility

 * Rerun - Robust to variations in expirement and set-up (days, operators)
 * Replicate - Defend - Same lab, same set up, same experiment
 * Repeat - Certify - Independent lab
 * Reproduce - Compare - Variants in independent labs
 * Reuse - Transfer - Different experiments


## Structuring data analysis
(WB)

# Data analysis as one computation

## Basic joins

1. An inner join of `df1` and `df2`
Return only the rows in which the left table have matching keys in the right table.

2. An outer join of `df1` and `df2`
Returns all rows from both tables, join records from the left which have matching keys in the right table.
3. A left outer join (or simply left join) of `df1` and `df2`
Return all rows from the left table, and any rows with matching keys from the right table.
4. A right outer join of df1 and df2
Return all rows from the right table, and any rows with matching keys from the left table.
