<h1>UNIX Tutorial Eight </h1>
<h2>8.1 UNIX Variables</h2>
<p>Variables are a way of passing information from the shell to programs when 
  you run them. Programs look &quot;in the environment&quot; for particular variables 
  and if they are found will use the values stored. Some are set by the system, 
  others by you, yet others by the shell, or any program that loads another program. 
</p>
<p>Standard UNIX variables are split into two categories, environment variables 
  and shell variables. In broad terms, shell variables apply only to the current 
  instance of the shell and are used to set short-term working conditions; environment 
  variables have a farther reaching significance, and those set at login are valid 
  for the duration of the session. By convention, environment variables have UPPER 
  CASE and shell variables have lower case names. </p>

<h2>8.2 Environment Variables</h2>
<p>An example of an environment variable is the OSTYPE variable. The value of 
  this is the current operating system you are using. Type </p>
<p class="command">% echo $OSTYPE </p>
<p>More examples of environment variables are </p>
<ul>
  <li> USER (your login name)</li>
  <li> HOME (the path name of your home directory)</li>
  <li> HOST (the name of the computer you are using)</li>
  <li> ARCH (the architecture of the computers processor)</li>
  <li> DISPLAY (the name of the computer screen to display X windows)</li>
  <li> PRINTER (the default printer to send print jobs)</li>
  <li> PATH (the directories the shell should search to find a command)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding out the current values of these variables.</h3>

<p>ENVIRONMENT variables are set using the <samp>setenv</samp> command, displayed 
  using the <samp>printenv</samp> or <samp>env</samp> commands, and unset using 
  the <samp>unsetenv</samp> command. </p>
<p>To show all values of these variables, type</p>
<p class="command">% printenv | less</p>
<h2>8.3 Shell Variables</h2>
<p>An example of a shell variable is the history variable. The value of this is 
  how many shell commands to save, allow the user to scroll back through all the 
  commands they have previously entered. Type</p>
<p class="command">% echo $history</p>
<p>More examples of shell variables are </p>
<ul>
  <li>cwd (your current working directory)
  </li>
  <li> home (the path name of your home directory)
  </li>
  <li> path (the directories the shell should search to find a command)
  </li>
  <li> prompt (the text string used to prompt for interactive commands shell your 
    login shell)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Finding out the current values of these variables.</h3>

<p>In the <samp>bash</samp> SHELL variables are set using the <samp>export</samp> command.  </p>
<p class="command"> % echo $hist</p>
<p class="command"> % export hist=200 </p>
<p class="command"> % printenv | grep $hist </p>

<h2>8.6 Setting the PATH</h2>
<p>When you type a command, your path (or PATH) variable defines in which directories 
  the shell will look to find the command you typed. If the system returns a message 
  saying &quot;command: Command not found&quot;, this indicates that either the 
  command doesn't exist at all on the system or it is simply not in your path. 
</p>
<p>For example, to run units, you either need to directly specify the units path 
  (<strong>~/units174/bin/units</strong>), or you need to have the directory <strong>~/units174/bin</strong> 
  in your path. </p>
<p>You can add it to the end of your existing path (the <strong>$path</strong> 
  represents this) by issuing the command: </p>
<p class="command"> % export PATH=$PATH:/Users/patrick.may/units174/bin</p>
<p>Test that this worked by trying to run units in any directory other that where 
  units is actually located. </p>
<p class="command">% cd; units</p>
<p class="hint"><strong>HINT:</strong> You can run multiple commands on one line 
  by separating them with a semicolon. </p>
<p>To add this path PERMANENTLY, add the following line to your .bashrc in your home
directory AFTER the list of other commands.</p>
