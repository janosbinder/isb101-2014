<h1>UNIX Tutorial Four </h1>
<h2>4.1 Wildcards</h2>
<h3>The characters * and ?</h3>
<p>The character * is called a wildcard, and will match against none or more character(s) 
  in a file (or directory) name. For example, in your <strong>unixstuff</strong> 
  directory, type </p>
<p class="command"> % ls list*</p>
<p>This will list all files in the current directory starting with <strong>list....</strong> 
</p>
<p> Try typing </p>
<p class="command"> % ls *list</p>
<p>This will list all files in the current directory ending with <strong>....list</strong></p>
<p>The character ? will match exactly one character.<br />
  So<samp> ls ?ouse </samp>will match files like <strong>house</strong> and <strong>mouse</strong>, 
  but not <strong>grouse</strong>. <br />
  Try typing </p>
<p class="command"> % ls ?list</p>
<h2>4.2 Filename conventions </h2>
<p>We should note here that a directory is merely a special type of file. So the 
  rules and conventions for naming files apply also to directories. </p>
<p> In naming files, characters with special meanings such as <strong>/ * &amp; 
  %</strong> , should be avoided. Also, avoid using spaces within names. The safest 
  way to name a file is to use only alphanumeric characters, that is, letters 
  and numbers, together with _ (underscore) and . (dot). </p>
<p> File names conventionally start with a lower-case letter, and may end with 
  a dot followed by a group of letters indicating the contents of the file. For 
  example, all files consisting of HTML code may be named with the ending .html, for 
  example, unix1.html . Then in order to list all files containing HTML code in the
  tutorial directory, you need only type</p> 
<p class="command">ls $HOME/unitut/*.html</p>
<p> in that directory. </p>

<h2>4.3 Getting Help</h2>
<h3><samp>man</samp> (On-line Manuals)</h3>
<p>There are on-line manuals which gives information about most commands. The 
  manual pages tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each 
  option modifies the behaviour of the command. Type <samp>man</samp> command to read the manual 
  page for a particular command. </p>
<p> For example, to find out more about the <samp>wc</samp> (word count) command, 
  type </p>
<p class="command"> % man wc </p>
<h3><samp>--help, -h</samp></h3>
Many programs implement their own help, which can be often retrieved with the parameters <samp>--help</samp? or <samp>-h</samp>.

<p>When you are not sure of the exact name of a command, </p>
<p class="command"> % apropos <var>keyword</var> </p>
<p> will give you the commands with keyword in their manual page header. For example, 
  try typing </p>
<p class="command"> % apropos word </p>
