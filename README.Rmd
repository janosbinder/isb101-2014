## Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains a modified version of the swirl lesson available on [github](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses).

### Tidying Data with tidyr

The original lesson was split into two parts to start with a lesson without any dplyr knowledge. The second part includes the remaining questions which are using dplyr and readr too.
